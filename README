About
-----

FooBarPong is a naive Pong clone implemented in order to learn the SDL
2.0 API.

Usage
-----

The goal of FooBarPong is for the player to get the ball past the
opponent's paddle. A player is awarded a single point if the ball
travels past the opponent's paddle. The ball will bounce off paddles,
the top of the play area, and the bottom of the play area.

Each player may control a single paddle on the player's respective
side of the game area. The left side paddle is controlled by the 'w'
and 's' keys. The right side paddle is controlled by the Up Arrow and
Down Arrow keys.
